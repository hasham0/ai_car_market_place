## ✨ Core Functionalities

### 🔍 Car Search & Filtering

- Multi-param car search (make, model, year, price, etc.)
- AI-powered image recognition (upload a car image to find similar)
- Natural language search (e.g., “Show me electric cars under $30k”)

### 👤 User Features

- Profile & account management
- Save favorite listings
- View history and saved searches
- Seller dashboard with car management

### 🧠 AI Integration

- Image-based car condition analysis
- Price prediction using ML models
- Smart recommendations (similar cars, trends)

---

## 🚀 Advanced Concepts

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for SEO
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- PWA support for offline experience
- Lazy loading and optimized image delivery
- Rate-limited API handlers for protection

---

## 🔁 Data Flow

### 🧾 State Management

- **Zustand**: Lightweight client-side state
- **React Query**: Server-side data synchronization
- **SWR**: API caching and auto-revalidation

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- NextAuth.js with Google/GitHub/email providers
- Secure JWT-based sessions
- Role-based access (Admin, Seller, Buyer)
- Middleware-protected API and routes

---

## 🌍 Deployment & Environment

- Hosted on **Vercel** with automatic CI/CD
- Environment secrets managed via `.env`
- Database hosted on **Neon**
- Image delivery via **ImageKit**
- GitHub Actions for testing & deployments

---

## 🧠 Suggestions for Improvement

### 🚅 Performance Optimizations

- Use **edge caching** for static assets
- Add **Redis layer** for query caching
- Replace `ImageKit` with `next/image` where possible

### 🏗️ Architecture Enhancements

- Integrate **tRPC** for end-to-end type safety
- Move towards **microservices** for scale
- Add **real-time notification system**

### 🔒 Security Upgrades

- Add **rate limiting** on AI API endpoints
- Introduce **input sanitization** middleware
- Use **Sentry/LogRocket** for error monitoring

### 🌐 Feature Additions

- Multi-language (i18n) support
- AI-powered **chatbot assistant**
- Integration with **vehicle history APIs** (Carfax, etc.)
